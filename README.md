# Cart-Pole_ActorCritic
 # A3C Training for CartPole  ## Overview  This notebook demonstrates the training of an agent using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to solve the CartPole environment. A3C is a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm designed for training agents on various tasks, and CartPole is a classic control problem in the Gymnasium environment.  ## Key Steps:  1. **Environment Initialization**: Creating an instance of the CartPole environment.  2. **A3C Agent Architecture**: Defining the A3C agent architecture, including the actor and critic networks.  3. **Training Loop**: Implementing the training loop for the A3C algorithm.  4. **Asynchronous Training**: Utilizing multiple asynchronous agents for more efficient training.  5. **Monitoring Training Progress**: Tracking and visualizing training progress, such as rewards and episode lengths.  ## Application:  - **Reinforcement Learning Research**: A3C is known for its efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of reinforcement learning tasks.  - **Continuous State and Action Spaces**: A3C is applicable to environments with continuous state and action spaces, making it versatile.  - **Policy Optimization**: A3C optimizes both policy (actor) and value function (critic) simultaneously.  ## Results:  - The training results, including rewards and episode lengths, are monitored and visualized.  - The trained A3C agent should demonstrate the ability to balance the pole on the cart effectively.  ## Note:  - Ensure that the required dependencies, including Gymnasium, TensorFlow, and other related libraries, are installed before running the notebook.  - Experiment with hyperparameters and training settings to observe their impact on the training performance.
